This is a coding project I've done quite early for my Cryptography class end-of-semester project.

Goal is to get a basic understanding of how to use Python for Crptography.

> Got a good understanding of Python libraries for encryption & and decryption (only one cryptography library though)

> All .txt files are just to test out the python program - nothing too serious

More fixes coming as I discover more content & tools
